There is a struct describing a Block Driver which has name BlockDriver
In the structure there are a number of function pointers that has to be filled
with different layers.

So far, I find out that there are format layer and protocol layer

Format layer defines in which format the data is stored, e.g qcow2 and others
Protocol layer defines which backend is used for actual data storage, e.g HDD, NBD, etc.
