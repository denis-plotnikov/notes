# before using ipmi serial-over-lan make sure you have the console
# redirected to a serial port ipmi listening to 
# in order to do that check line console=tty0 console=ttyS2,115200n8 exists in /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
# here ttyS2 corresponds to COM3: ttyS[X] = COM[Y] where X = Y - 1
# the ttyS[X] have to be properly set to a value that ipmi uses
# you can find this value in BIOS in ipmi settings
