Hi!

I've created account for dplotnikov on KA server https://ka.stable.lps.plesk.ru:4000 

So, you can log to it and create any licenses you need in KA UI. Also i've created Partner API account for you, so you can create any licenses programmatically. Credentials for your account sent by private e-mail. Documentation for work with KA by Partner API can be found here - https://central.odin.com/docs/partner-api/1.0/

Feel free to reach me directly for any further question about KA UI or Partner API.

Credentials for work with KA Stable server:
