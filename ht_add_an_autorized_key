To make sure your host is visible for the testing framework do the following
sequence found in the documentation at 
http://home.parallels.com/wiki/Atomic%20tests-%20Technical%20Notes#Linux
:
	1. install openssh-server, add then (usualy installed by default)
	2. cat id_rsa.pub >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
		(i.e. put the key found at 
		 http://perf.sw.ru/distrib/WinSSHD.v4.19/ClientTools/id_rsa.pub
		 to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys of the server being tuned 
		 make sure /root/.ssh/authorized_key has 600 privileges
		 (i.e chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys) 
		)
	3. edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and set
		---------------------------------------------
		RSAAuthentication yes
		PubkeyAuthentication yes
		AuthorizedKeysFile      .ssh/authorized_keys
 		---------------------------------------------
	4. restart the openssh-server to make sure it knows about the changes 
	   made
		(i.e. /etc/init/sshd restart)

Everything should be ok now
